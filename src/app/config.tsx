                Hi! I'm Alvin, a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> who started coding in <strong>2023</strong>. Since then, I've built <strong>streaming platforms</strong>, <strong>blogs</strong>, and <strong>e-commerce sites</strong>. Whether it's front-end finesse or back-end logic, I love bringing ideas to life on the web.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing <strong>Dota 2</strong>, cooking up new recipes, or streaming on <strong>Kick</strong>. Let's connect—I'd love to help with your next <strong>website</strong> or <strong>API</strong> project!
